Getting Started
===============

**Note: If you installed by using the debian package and answered the configuration questions you already have a working setup. If you skipped the questions you will still already have the PAM module itself already setup. Continue with "Setting up Devices and Users" in that case.**

Setting up pam_usb requires the following, [[once pam_usb is installed|Install]]:

1. Set up devices and users
2. Configuring PAM for system authentication
3. (Optional) Configuring `pamusb-agent` to run programs when the device is inserted or removed

Setting up Devices and Users
----------------------------

Once you've connected your USB device to the computer, use pamusb-conf to add it to the configuration file:

    # pamusb-conf --add-device MyDevice
    Please select the device you wish to add.
    * Using "SanDisk Corp. Cruzer Titanium (SNDKXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX)" (only option)
    Which volume would you like to use for storing data ?
    * Using "/dev/sda1 (UUID: <6F6B-42FC>)" (only option)
    Name            : MyDevice
    Vendor          : SanDisk Corp.
    Model           : Cruzer Titanium
    Serial          : SNDKXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    Volume UUID     : 6F6B-42FC (/dev/sda1)
    Save to /etc/security/pam_usb.conf ?
    [Y/n] y
    Done.

Note that `MyDevice` can be any arbitrary name you'd like. Also, you can add as many devices as you want.

Next, configure users you want to be able to authenticate with pam_usb:

    # pamusb-conf --add-user root      
    Which device would you like to use for authentication ?
    * Using "MyDevice" (only option)
    User            : root
    Device          : MyDevice
    Save to /etc/security/pam_usb.conf ?
    [Y/n] y
    Done.

Check the configuration
-----------------------

You can run `pamusb-check` anytime to check if everything is correctly worked.
This tool will simulate an authentication request (requires your device to be connected, otherwise it will fail).

    # pamusb-check root
    * Authentication request for user "root" (pamusb-check)
    * Device "MyDevice" is connected (good).
    * Performing one time pad verification...
    * Verification match, updating one time pads...
    * Access granted.


Setting up the PAM module
-------------------------

To add pam_usb into the system authentication process, we need to edit `/etc/pam.d/common-auth`
    
    NOTE: If you are using RedHat, Arch or Fedora this file can be known as /etc/pam/system-auth.

Your default PAM common-auth configuration should include the following line:

    auth    required        pam_unix.so nullok_secure

This is a current standard which uses passwords to authenticate a user.

Alter your /etc/pam.d/common-auth configuration to:

    auth    sufficient      pam_usb.so
    auth    required        pam_unix.so nullok_secure

The `sufficient` keyword means that if pam_usb allows the authentication, then no password will be asked.
If the authentication fails, then the default password-based authentication will be used as fallback.

If you change it to `required`, it means that *both* the USB flash drive and the password will be required to grant
access to the system.

At this point, you should be able to authenticate with the relevant USB device plugged-in.

    scox $ su
    * pam_usb v.SVN
    * Authentication request for user "root" (su)
    * Device "MyDevice" is connected (good).
    * Performing one time pad verification...
    * Verification match, updating one time pads...
    * Access granted.

Agent
-----

The pam_usb agent (pamusb-agent) allows you to automatically execute commands
upon locking and unlocking events. Those events are generated when you insert or
remove your authentication device.
To configure the commands, you have to edit pam_usb's configuration file
(/etc/security/pam_usb.conf) and add agent entries into your user section.

For instance, you could automatically start your screensaver as soon as you
remove the device, and deactivate it when you plug the device back.

You can find details in [the "Agent" section of Configuration](https://github.com/mcdope/pam_usb/wiki/Configuration#agent)

Fine Tuning
-----------

There are many options available to configure pam_usb.
